project_aazhao:
This folder contains the code written by Alanis Zhao for the project. 

    baseline:
    This folder contains code to process the baseline dataset. This includes 
    the baseline dataset and a python file which can be run with 
    python3 process.py to print out the ratio of positive to negative tweets & 
    the total # of positive/negative/neutral tweets. 

    plots:
    This folder contains the plots generated by the independent cascade with 
    decay spreading process. It contains plots of the positive/total tweet 
    ratio and plots of the total # of positive and negative nodes in each 
    network for each simulation with different parameters. 

    network_structure:
    This folder contains 3 python files which can be run with python3 
    fileName.py to analyze the network structure of the given network. It also 
    contains the networks as downloaded from their respective datasets and 
    plots for each network showing the degree distribution. 

    independent.py:
    This file can be run with python3 independent.py. This file runs the 
    independent cascade with decay spreading process for positive/negative 
    nodes for all combinations of the given parameters. It produces the graphs 
    in the plots folder.
