This project contains multiple large files. We used Git LFS to manage them.

We used AI assistance for general guidance on how to use certain Python libraries, specifically NetworkX and matplotlib. This included clarifying function usage, typical workflows, and common patterns for graph processing and visualization. All core design decisions, implementation, and analysis were completed by us.

project_aazhao:
This folder contains the code written by Alanis Zhao for the project. 

    baseline:
    This folder contains code to process the baseline dataset. This includes 
    the baseline dataset and a python file which can be run with 
    python3 process.py to print out the ratio of positive to negative tweets & 
    the total # of positive/negative/neutral tweets. 

    plots:
    This folder contains the plots generated by the independent cascade with 
    decay spreading process. It contains plots of the positive/total tweet 
    ratio and plots of the total # of positive and negative nodes in each 
    network for each simulation with different parameters. 

    network_structure:
    This folder contains 3 python files which can be run with python3 
    fileName.py to analyze the network structure of the given network. It also 
    contains the networks as downloaded from their respective datasets and 
    plots for each network showing the degree distribution. 

    independent.py:
    This file can be run with python3 independent.py. This file runs the 
    independent cascade with decay spreading process for positive/negative 
    nodes for all combinations of the given parameters. It produces the graphs 
    in the plots folder. 

project_mandyh:
This folder contains project code written by Mandy Hu

    networks:
    This folder contains the network models used within the project, 
    downloaded from their datasets.

    plots:
    This folder contains all the graphs generated for the threshold model with
    heterogeneous thresholds. The plots show the positive/ total tweet ratio 
    as well as the total number of positive and negative nodes in each network 
    for different parameter combinations.

    threshold-model.py
    This file contains the threshold model with heterogeneous thresholds 
    implementation, and runs the spreading process with all three networks and
    different parameter combinations. It produces graphs for each combination 
    and saves them in the plots folder.

project_choysal:
This folder contains project code written by Charvi Hoysal

    plots:
    This folder contains all the graphs generated for the SIR Model with the given 
    network files. The plots show the positive/ total tweet ratio as well as the 
    total number of positive and negative nodes in each network for different 
    parameters.

    SIR.py
    This file contains the SIR implementation, and runs the spreading process 
    with all three networks and different parameter combinations. It produces 
    graphs for each combination and saves them in the plots folder.
